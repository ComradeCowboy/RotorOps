You can put .miz files in this folder to be copied into the generated mission at marker points.  This feature is currently very 'alpha' and may produce errors.  Currently, this doesn't work for ship groups or plane groups.

1) Make an empty mission on Cauacasus.

2) Place units/objects on the map.

3) Make one unit group name: 'ANCHOR'  This will represent the point of insertion into the target mission. 

4) In a Scenario template, place a static object (flag, etc) and call it "IMPORT-[filename of .miz created in first step]" Country should be CJTF Red, CJTF Blue, or UN Peacekeepers.

5) Change the unit name of the object created in the previous step.  This unit name might be used for spawn names, so you should call the unit name something like "North Base" so players know where they'll be spawning when choosing a slot.  


Tips: 
-You can change the heading of the imported group by changing the heading of the insertion object.
-For multiple imports of the same template, the import object group name should end with '-01' or '-whatever'.
