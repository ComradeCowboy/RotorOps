You can put .miz files in this folder to be copied into the generated mission at marker points.  This feature is currently very 'alpha' and may produce errors.

1) Make an empty mission on Cauacasus.
2) Place units/objects on the map.
3) Make one unit group name: 'ANCHOR'  This will represent the point of insertion into the target mission.
4) In a Scenario template, place a static object (flag, etc) and call it "IMPORT-[filename of .miz created in first step]"

Tip: You can change the heading of the imported group by changing the heading of the insertion object.
