You can add your own scenarios in this directory and they will appear in the mission generator.  See the other scenario .miz files for examples of what to include in your template.


A scenario .miz file MUST have:

1) Between 1-4 trigger zones called "ALPHA", "BRAVO", "CHARLIE", "DELTA"
2) At least one trigger zone with a name that starts with "STAGING".
3) A blue airport (recommend somewhere near/on-side your staging zone). 
4) A red airport (recommend somewhere near/on-side your last conflict zone).  
5) At least one Russian unit or static object.  Anything will work, even a cow.  You can set "HIDDEN ON MAP".
6) At least one USA unit or static object. See previous point.



Optional: 
7) USA FARP called "HELO_FARP" for automatic player placement.
8) USA Carrier called "HELO_CARRIER" for automatic player placement.
9) Infantry spawn zones inside conflict zones. Add near buildings to simulate infantry hiding within. Name trigger zones like "ALPHA_SPAWN", "ALPHA_SPAWN_2, etc.



Tips:
-Position the center of conflict zones over an open area, as this position may be used to spawn units.
-Position the center of staging zones over an open area of at least 1000 x 1000ft to provide space for logistics units. 
Position the center of staging zones over an open area of at least 1000 x 1000ft to provide space for logistics units. 
-For very scenery dense areas like forests or urban areas, smaller conflict zone sizes are highly recommended (eg 4000ft radius).  A zone center near a roadway may also help keep units moving smoothly. 
-The conflict game type can be played with blue forces on defense.  In this mode the last conflict zone is the only troop pickup zone.
-Design your template so that it can be played in normal 'attacking' mode or 'defending' the conflict zone from enemy ground units starting from the staging zone.
-Keep the zones fairly close together, both for helicopter and ground unit travel times. 
-You can place static objects and units in a scenario template.
-You can change mission briefing and other mission options in the template.
-Drop your templates in the RotorOps Discord if you'd like to have them added in a release for everyone. Maintain a similar naming convention and be sure to credit yourself in the .miz name. 
-Airfields can be captured with ground units.  You might consider placing conflict zones over neutral airfields for a rearming area, or perhaps unarmed client slots. 
-Player/client slots are placed in this priority order:  Carrier named "HELO_CARRIER", FARP named "HELO_FARP", and the blue airfield.
-Friendly AWACs and tankers will be placed at the blue airport if parking is available, otherwise they will start in the air.  
-Enemy helicopters and planes will spawn at the red airport. 
-Late activation FARPs might be useful for rearming far from the player spawn point.
